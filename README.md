# Sea Ice Concentration Forecasting
This is follow-on work from the forecasting September sea ice extent using Complex Networks and Gaussian Process Regression (see repository: ![SeaIceExtentForecasting](https://github.com/William-gregory/SeaIceExtentForecasting) )

This contains code used to generate spatial forecasts of sea ice concentration in the East Siberian and Laptev seas using multi-task Gaussian Process Regression, in a non-stationary inter-task covariance structure. This code is largely based on previous work by:
